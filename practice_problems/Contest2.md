## Java Questions on 1D and 2D Arrays

### 1. Array is AP

In the first line you are given an integer input `n`, followed by `n` numbers. It is possible that the numbers in the array might be in an arithmetic progression.
Your task is to find out if the array elements are indeed in an AP and if so then print the comman difference of the AP.

Note:
1. An AP is a sequence of numbers that looks like `a, (a+d), (a+2d), (a+3d) . . .` where both `a` and `d` are constants.
2. Common difference of an AP is the term by which an element is incremented to get the next element. In this case it is `d`.
